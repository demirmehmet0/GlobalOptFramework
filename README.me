In this folder, there are a total of 2 files and 6 folders

Each of these folders represents an algorithm.

The parameter file must be edited for the framework to work.
Values ​​in parameters.txt should be set as:

ALGORITHM - The algorithm to be compiled 
        ALGORITHM=1 - XZLBZ                             -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=2 - BP                                -> (MATRIX_PATH, NUM_MATRICES, THRESHOLD, DEPTH)
        ALGORITHM=3 - RNBP                              -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=4 - A1                                -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=5 - A2                                -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=6 - Paar1                             -> (MATRIX_PATH, NUM_MATRICES, THRESHOLD)
        ALGORITHM=7 - Paar2                             -> (MATRIX_PATH, NUM_MATRICES, THRESHOLD)
        ALGORITHM=8 - LWFWSW                            -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=9 - BFI                               -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=10 - BFI-Paar1                        -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=11 - BFI-RPaar1                       -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=12 - BFI-BP                           -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=13 - BFI-A1                           -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=14 - BFI-A2                           -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=15 - BFI-RNBP                         -> (MATRIX_PATH, ITERATION)
        ALGORITHM=16 - BFI-BP-depthConstrained          -> (MATRIX_PATH, NUM_MATRICES, THRESHOLD, DEPTH, BFI)

MATRIX_PATH - The path to the matrix file
        MATRIX_PATH=path/to/matrix/file

ITERATION - The number of iterations to be performed
        ITERATION=10
        
An example command will be:
        python3 main.py

The matrix formats to be sent to the algorithms are given in the matrices folder.
