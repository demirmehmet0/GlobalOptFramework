main_globalopt.cpp - the main program for RNBP, A1 and A2.
This program requires compilation it with C++11 or newer.
There are also 2 arguments that one has to set during compile time: 

TIME_LIMIT - The amount of time (in seconds) allowed to run the program
OPTION - The algorithm to be compiled 
        OPTION=1 - RNBP
        OPTION=2 - A1
        OPTION=3 - A2
An example command will be:
        g++ -std=c++11 -o main_globalopt.out -D OPTION=1 -D TIME_LIMIT=1000 main_globalopt.cpp

To run the program, we feed the matrix into the program:
        ./main_globalopt.out < ./global_test/testmat.txt

An example of an input matrix is given in ./global_test/testmat.txt

main_localopt.py - the main program for localOpt
This program executes localOpt on all the files in local_test_source folder and save the results in local_test_dest
It requires BinaryTree.py and gendistinct.py

BinaryTree.py, gendistinct.py
Programs to supplement main_locallopt.py for localOpt operation.

global_test folder - contains testmat.txt, a chosen matrix from the benchmark set

local_test_source - contains test_circuit.txt, the circuit generated by A2 of the chosen matrix in global_test folder
